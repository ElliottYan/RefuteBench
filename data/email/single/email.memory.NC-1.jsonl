Bordering town, the National Elk Refuge protects the largest herd of wintering elk in the world. In season, you can ride horse-drawn sleighs into the refuge to view these gentle creatures up close.\n\nCamouflaged in a rocky hillside just south of town, the National Museum of Wildlife Art is another top attraction, with more than 4,000 paintings and many rotating exhibits.\n3. The Cody Firearms Museum contains a large collection of firearms from around the world. Wyoming wildlife and geology are the main themes of the Draper Museum of Natural History, and you can learn about the culture of the prairies' first inhabitants at the Plains Indian Museum through exhibits and a multimedia show.\n4. Cheyenne, the capital of Wyoming, offers a host of rewarding things to do in southern Wyoming. Named after the Cheyenne Indians, it was once the largest outpost of the United States Cavalry. Today, the town's museums and historic sites tell the story of Cheyenne's beginnings in 1867 as a station on the Union Pacific Railroad.\nOne of the town's top attractions is the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. Held annually since 1919, the late-July rodeo, featuring 10 days of fun-filled festivities, is one of the best in the country. For a taste of the Wild West at other times of the year, head to the Cheyenne Frontier Days Old West Museum, with rodeo exhibits and antique horse-drawn wagons.\n5. Looking for the spectacular alpine scenery of Grand Teton National Park or Yellowstone without the crowds? Head to the Wind River Range in Western Wyoming. Its 2.25 million acres encompass seven of the largest glaciers in the Lower 48 states; lush meadows dappled with wildflowers; glacier-carved valleys; snowcapped peaks; and thousands of sparkling trout-filled waterways, including the headwater for the Green River. No wonder it's a haven for hiking, hunting, fishing, camping, and climbing."]}

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse", "I'm an undergraduate student, and I want to ask a professor if I can do some research with them in molecular biology.
