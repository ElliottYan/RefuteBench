Although fictional in literature, the legend is based on an astrologer and alchemist who lived in the area of northern Germany in the fifteenth century.\n\nTrained in theology, he turns to magic and makes a perilous deal with the Devil in which he commits his soul to eternal damnation in return for power and knowledge in this life. But he is only human, and arrogant and reckless. Can Faust — or anyone — wield the powers of God or resist the temptations of the Devil?\n\nThe legend has inspired many great writers, musicians, and other artists. The earliest known published sources for the legend are the Wolfenbüttler manuscript dated about 1580-1587, and a printed chapbook (the Spies edition), intended for popular sale dated 1587. Two famous literary works on the Faust theme are Christopher Marlowe’s The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, and Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe’s Faust.\n\nWhile Goethe’s Faust has been called the definitive Faust, there is no one Faust story, instead, there are hundreds or thousands of variations on the theme in theatre, music, film, poetry, art, and literature including classics and favorites: The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, The Picture of Dorian Grey, The Phantom of the Opera/Paradise, The Devil and Daniel Webster, Damn Yankees, The Little Shop of Horrors and many more.\n\n"]}

Hissing geysers, bubbling mud pots, and steaming hot springs betray the forces that formed this staggering landscape millions of years ago. Waterfalls gush down steep ravines, and glittering lakes and rivers stretch for miles. The highlights of Yellowstone National Park include the famous Old Faithful geyser, Yellowstone Lake, and the jaw-dropping cascades of Lower Falls.\n\nYou can drive through the park, but the huge network of hiking trails is the best way to appreciate the park's diverse ecosystems. It's easy to extend a wilderness experience by staying in one of the park's scenic campgrounds.\n2. Jackson is also the gateway to beautiful Grand Teton National Park and a popular stop on the way to Yellowstone. Bordering town, the National Elk Refuge protects the largest herd of wintering elk in the world. In season, you can ride horse-drawn sleighs into the refuge to view these gentle creatures up close.\n\nCamouflaged in a rocky hillside just south of town, the National Museum of Wildlife Art is another top attraction, with more than 4,000 paintings and many rotating exhibits.\n3. The Cody Firearms Museum contains a large collection of firearms from around the world. Wyoming wildlife and geology are the main themes of the Draper Museum of Natural History, and you can learn about the culture of the prairies' first inhabitants at the Plains Indian Museum through exhibits and a multimedia show.\n4. Cheyenne, the capital of Wyoming, offers a host of rewarding things to do in southern Wyoming. Named after the Cheyenne Indians, it was once the largest outpost of the United States Cavalry. Today, the town's museums and historic sites tell the story of Cheyenne's beginnings in 1867 as a station on the Union Pacific Railroad.\nOne of the town's top attractions is the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. Held annually since 1919, the late-July rodeo, featuring 10 days of fun-filled festivities, is one of the best in the country. For a taste of the Wild West at other times of the year, head to the Cheyenne Frontier Days Old West Museum, with rodeo exhibits and antique horse-drawn wagons.\n5. Looking for the spectacular alpine scenery of Grand Teton National Park or Yellowstone without the crowds? Head to the Wind River Range in Western Wyoming. Its 2.25 million acres encompass seven of the largest glaciers in the Lower 48 states; lush meadows dappled with wildflowers; glacier-carved valleys; snowcapped peaks; and thousands of sparkling trout-filled waterways, including the headwater for the Green River. No wonder it's a haven for hiking, hunting, fishing, camping, and climbing."]}

Hissing geysers, bubbling mud pots, and steaming hot springs betray the forces that formed this staggering landscape millions of years ago. Waterfalls gush down steep ravines, and glittering lakes and rivers stretch for miles. The highlights of Yellowstone National Park include the famous Old Faithful geyser, Yellowstone Lake, and the jaw-dropping cascades of Lower Falls.\n\nYou can drive through the park, but the huge network of hiking trails is the best way to appreciate the park's diverse ecosystems. It's easy to extend a wilderness experience by staying in one of the park's scenic campgrounds.\n2. Jackson is also the gateway to beautiful Grand Teton National Park and a popular stop on the way to Yellowstone. Bordering town, the National Elk Refuge protects the largest herd of wintering elk in the world. In season, you can ride horse-drawn sleighs into the refuge to view these gentle creatures up close.\n\nCamouflaged in a rocky hillside just south of town, the National Museum of Wildlife Art is another top attraction, with more than 4,000 paintings and many rotating exhibits.\n3. The Cody Firearms Museum contains a large collection of firearms from around the world. Wyoming wildlife and geology are the main themes of the Draper Museum of Natural History, and you can learn about the culture of the prairies' first inhabitants at the Plains Indian Museum through exhibits and a multimedia show.\n4. Cheyenne, the capital of Wyoming, offers a host of rewarding things to do in southern Wyoming. Named after the Cheyenne Indians, it was once the largest outpost of the United States Cavalry. Today, the town's museums and historic sites tell the story of Cheyenne's beginnings in 1867 as a station on the Union Pacific Railroad.\nOne of the town's top attractions is the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. Held annually since 1919, the late-July rodeo, featuring 10 days of fun-filled festivities, is one of the best in the country. For a taste of the Wild West at other times of the year, head to the Cheyenne Frontier Days Old West Museum, with rodeo exhibits and antique horse-drawn wagons.\n5. Looking for the spectacular alpine scenery of Grand Teton National Park or Yellowstone without the crowds? Head to the Wind River Range in Western Wyoming. Its 2.25 million acres encompass seven of the largest glaciers in the Lower 48 states; lush meadows dappled with wildflowers; glacier-carved valleys; snowcapped peaks; and thousands of sparkling trout-filled waterways, including the headwater for the Green River.

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.
